# Openouts

outlaying the free and open wares of the world

## Forewords

Gathering a bunch of free "public domain content" from all over!

## Hallmarks

Soon it will have these folders:

* **books** (in "PDF" format)
* **codes** (written in many ways)
* **films** (mostly old stuff)
* **looks** ("photography" or light-writing)
* **songs** (sounds of many kinds)
* **words** (writings smaller than books)

## Runtimes

No software - just folders of stuff to look into!

## Setup

No setup - just look in the manifolds!

## Thanks

Thanks to the "commons"!
